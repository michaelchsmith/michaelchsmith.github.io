I am an embedded systems engineer with hands-on experience across the full product lifecycle â€” from concept and design, through prototyping and development, to testing, manufacturing, and deployment. My work includes hardware design all the way through to firmware/software interactions. I combine my technical depth with a grounded approach focusing on delivering something real and impactful to customers.
